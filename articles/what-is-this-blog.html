    <h1>What Is This Blog?</h1>
    <p>
      This blog is a place for me to materialize some of the thoughts I have
      about finance and investing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I am classically trained in finance and hold the designations
      necessary to manage investment portfolios and provide financial advice,
      nothing on this blog should be thought of as relating to these things. In
      fact, almost all the ideas I present on this blog land outside the
      boundary of what I would describe as "normal" finance. Truthfully, that is
      a principle purpose of this blog--to offer me an outlet to express views
      about finance which areâ€¦ less mainstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're looking for textbook, correct information in finance or a
      systematic coverage of some specific topics, this is not the blog for you.
      However, if you have an open mind and are willing to think deeply about
      the common financial wisdom floating in the world with a critical eye,
      then I welcome you.
    </p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy your reading.</p>
