    <h1>The Hard Thing About Finance</h1>
    <p>
      The hard thing about finance is that it doesn't make sense. Bear with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physics makes sense. Biology reflects a beauty of the natural world and chemistry explains every observable phenomenon. The natural sciences describe... nature: something created by means beyond human intervention, which we have manufactured tools to understand. Finance is not a natural science.
    </p>
    <p>
      If economics is the study of the economy then finance is the study of decision-making within such economies. The economy does not occur naturally. The exchange of goods and services, the formation of public and private sector institutions, and the flourishing of stock markets and capitalism are not naturally-occurring phenomena in the same way that a forest or river, the sky or the clouds, and mice or owls occur naturally. Finance is hard because it is a discipline characterized by the use of man-made tools to study man-made constructs; and since we've been historically inferior to nature when it comes to design and architecture, that is a decidedly more tortured discipline than one characterized by the use of man-made tools to study natural constructs, as one could say of the natural sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three ways finance is hard, as a result of this unfortunate consequence of design, and understanding these three obstacles helps us make better financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, if finance is about decision-making within economies, then I would posit that our means of perceiving such economies is critically important--for, we cannot drive the car if we cannot see out the window. The first critical realization is that finance uses man-made data to measure man-made economic constructs; and since anything man-made is bound to be imperfect, we are impaired at the outset in our ability to adequately intake information for decision-making purposes. It's impossible to make good decisions without information and, since the stakes are high, we must assume all man-made information is bad, until shown otherwise. Instead of relying on this flawed information invented by economists, I find it’s usually more useful to use addition and subtraction to make simple calculations, which supplement common sense and clear thinking for good decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, effective decision-making requires that we be singular in our goals and varied in our methods (of achieving those goals). However, the reality of most people's circumstances is that they are rather varied in their goals and singular in their capabilities to achieve those goals. That is: even if we are able to intake, parse, and analyze good information, most of us are, by no control of our own, naturally impaired from making good decisions. One way you know if this applies to you is whether or not you ever feel stress. Stress is a biological signal that you lack the methods to make a decision about your circumstances because doing so would jeopardize your achieving one or more of your varied goals. We suck at decision-making because we're not really built for it; but, if you can release yourself from the burden of wanting many things and open your mind to learning just about anything, without prejudice, then you'll quickly find your skill-set expanding and your goal-set focusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, even if we make good decisions on the basis of sound data, we run up against the most formidable problem of boredom. Boredom is an industry worth trillions of dollars. Movies, games, vacations, and indulgences... are all products of boredom. It turns out that robotically making the right decision at every turn based on the most surgically-correct data is monotonous, and we hate monotony--in fact, in many ways we're disgusted by it. That is boredom: a powerful force which pushes us away from making good decisions, even though we know better. Finance is seriously hard, and it is only made harder if you insist on chasing the exciting, new things rather than embracing the dull, same things.

      It's simple. Be skeptical of experts, think for yourself and think clearly, focus your goals and learn without prejudice, and keep good habits. You’ll be an expert in no time.
